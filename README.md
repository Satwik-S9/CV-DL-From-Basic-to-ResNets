# Image Classification: From Basic Neural Networks to Residual Networks
> @author: [Satwik Srivastava](https://github.com/Satwik-S9)


## Description
- In this Repo I create Image Classification Models using Pytorch. 
- We start from a very simple Neural Network and Go all the way upto Residual Networks to
see how they perform in different Image classification tasks.
